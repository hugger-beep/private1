# Data Residency Compliance Strategy

## Overview

Data residency requirements mandate that an organization's data must be stored and processed within specific geographic boundaries. For customer1, this means ensuring that customer data for US organizations remains in US regions and Canadian organization data remains in Canadian regions, while maintaining a seamless user experience across the platform.

## Data Residency Requirements

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Data Residency Model"
        OrgA[US Organization] --> USData[(US Region Data Store)]
        OrgB[Canadian Organization] --> CAData[(Canadian Region Data Store)]
        
        User1[US User] --> OrgA
        User2[Canadian User] --> OrgB
        
        RefData[(Common Reference Data)] -- "One-way sync" --> USData
        RefData -- "One-way sync" --> CAData
    end
```

## Key Principles

1. **Organization-Based Data Isolation**:
   - Each organization's data resides exclusively in their chosen region
   - No cross-region data storage for organization-specific data
   - Clear boundaries between regional data stores

2. **Common Reference Data Synchronization**:
   - Course content, assessment frameworks, and other reference data synchronized across regions
   - Master data maintained in ca-central-1 and replicated to other regions
   - One-way synchronization to ensure consistency

3. **User-to-Organization Binding**:
   - Users are associated with specific organizations
   - Authentication directs users to their organization's regional backend
   - Cross-organization access managed through explicit permissions

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Data Partitioning Strategy

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Data Partitioning"
        OrgRegistry[(Organization Registry)]
        
        subgraph "Canada Region"
            CAOrgs[(Canadian Organizations)]
            CAUsers[(Canadian Users)]
            CAActivity[(User Activity Data)]
            CAReporting[(Reporting Data)]
        end
        
        subgraph "US Region"
            USOrgs[(US Organizations)]
            USUsers[(US Users)]
            USActivity[(User Activity Data)]
            USReporting[(Reporting Data)]
        end
        
        OrgRegistry --> CAOrgs
        OrgRegistry --> USOrgs
        
        CAOrgs --> CAUsers
        CAUsers --> CAActivity
        CAActivity --> CAReporting
        
        USOrgs --> USUsers
        USUsers --> USActivity
        USActivity --> USReporting
    end
```

- **Organization Registry**:
  - Global DynamoDB table storing organization metadata
  - Maps organization IDs to their designated AWS region
  - Used during authentication to route users to correct regional backend

- **Regional Data Stores**:
  - Separate RDS instances in each region
  - No cross-region replication of organization-specific data
  - Complete data isolation between regions

### 2. Reference Data Synchronization

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Master as Master Data (ca-central-1)
    participant DMS as AWS DMS
    participant US as US Region Data (us-east-1)
    
    Note over Master: Reference data updated
    Master->>DMS: Change Data Capture
    DMS->>US: Replicate changes
    Note over US: Reference data updated
    
    Note over Master,US: Daily full sync job
    Master->>DMS: Full table comparison
    DMS->>US: Synchronize differences
    Note over US: Reference data validated
```

- **AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)**:
  - Continuous replication for reference tables
  - One-way synchronization from master (ca-central-1) to other regions
  - Change Data Capture (CDC) for efficient updates

- **Reference Data Tables**:
  - Course content and metadata
  - Assessment frameworks and questions
  - System configuration parameters
  - Other non-organization-specific reference data

### 3. Data Access Controls

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Data Access Control"
        User[User] --> Auth[Authentication]
        Auth --> JWT[JWT Token with Claims]
        
        JWT --> APIGateway[API Gateway]
        APIGateway --> AuthZ[Authorization Check]
        
        AuthZ --> OrgCheck[Organization Check]
        OrgCheck --> RoleCheck[Role-Based Access]
        RoleCheck --> ScopeCheck[Permission Scope]
        
        ScopeCheck --> Allow[Allow Access]
        ScopeCheck --> Deny[Deny Access]
    end
```

- **JWT Token Claims**:
  - Organization ID embedded in authentication token
  - User roles and permissions included as claims
  - Token issued by regional Cognito instance

- **API Authorization**:
  - API Gateway validates token and extracts claims
  - Organization ID verified against request context
  - Role-based access control enforced at API level

- **Database-Level Controls**:
  - Row-level security in PostgreSQL for analytics data
  - Application-enforced tenant isolation
  - Query filtering based on organization ID

## Compliance Monitoring and Auditing

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Compliance Monitoring"
        DataAccess[Data Access Events] --> CloudTrail[AWS CloudTrail]
        CloudTrail --> CloudWatch[CloudWatch Logs]
        
        CloudWatch --> Rules[CloudWatch Rules]
        Rules --> Alerts[Compliance Alerts]
        
        CloudWatch --> Dashboard[Compliance Dashboard]
        CloudWatch --> Reports[Compliance Reports]
        
        DataAccess --> AccessLogs[Access Logs]
        AccessLogs --> LogInsights[CloudWatch Log Insights]
        LogInsights --> Analysis[Compliance Analysis]
    end
```

- **Access Logging**:
  - Comprehensive logging of all data access events
  - API Gateway request logging
  - Database query logging for sensitive operations

- **Compliance Alerting**:
  - Automated detection of potential compliance violations
  - Alerts for cross-region data access attempts
  - Notification of configuration changes affecting data residency

- **Regular Auditing**:
  - Scheduled compliance reviews
