# Regional Routing Optimization Strategy

## Current Routing Challenge

customer currently operates in a single region (ca-central-1), but needs to expand to multiple regions while ensuring users are directed to the appropriate regional backend based on their organization's data residency requirements. This document outlines a strategy for optimizing regional routing to provide low-latency access while maintaining data residency compliance.

## Proposed Regional Routing Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Client Layer"
        MobileApp[Mobile App]
        WebApp[Web App]
    end
    
    subgraph "Global Routing Layer"
        R53[Amazon Route 53]
        GA[AWS Global Accelerator]
        CF[Amazon CloudFront]
    end
    
    subgraph "Regional Determination Layer"
        OrgLookup[Organization Lookup Service]
        OrgDB[(Organization Registry)]
    end
    
    subgraph "Regional Endpoints"
        CAAPI[Canada API Endpoint]
        USAPI[US API Endpoint]
    end
    
    MobileApp --> GA
    WebApp --> CF
    
    CF --> OrgLookup
    GA --> OrgLookup
    
    OrgLookup --> OrgDB
    
    OrgLookup --> CAAPI
    OrgLookup --> USAPI
```

## Key Components

### 1. Global Entry Points

- **AWS Global Accelerator**:
  - Static IP addresses for mobile app connectivity
  - Anycast IP routing to nearest AWS edge location
  - TCP connection termination at the edge for reduced latency
  - Ideal for mobile applications with persistent connections

- **Amazon CloudFront**:
  - Content delivery network for web application assets
  - Edge caching of static content
  - Dynamic content routing based on request attributes
  - Lambda@Edge functions for routing logic

- **Amazon Route 53**:
  - Global DNS service with health checking
  - Geolocation and latency-based routing policies
  - Failover routing for high availability
  - Integration with Global Accelerator and CloudFront

### 2. Organization Lookup Service

```mermaid

    participant User as Mobile User
    participant App as Mobile App
    participant GA as Global Accelerator
    participant Lookup as Org Lookup Service
    participant OrgDB as Organization Registry
    participant API as Regional API
    
    User->>App: Launch App
    App->>GA: Initial Connection
    GA->>Lookup: Forward Request
    
    Note over Lookup,OrgDB: First-time login
    Lookup->>App: Request Organization ID
    App->>User: Prompt for Organization
    User->>App: Select Organization
    App->>Lookup: Submit Organization ID
    
    Lookup->>OrgDB: Query Organization Region
    OrgDB-->>Lookup: Return Region (US/Canada)
    
    Lookup->>App: Return Regional Endpoint
    App->>API: Connect to Regional API
    
    Note over App: Store regional endpoint
    
    Note over User,API: Subsequent sessions
    User->>App: Launch App
    App->>API: Direct Connection to Regional API
```

- **Organization Registry**:
  - DynamoDB Global Table storing organization-to-region mappings
  - Low-latency lookups from any region
  - Cached results for improved performance

- **Lookup Service**:
  - Lambda function deployed in multiple regions
  - Determines appropriate regional endpoint based on organization ID
  - Caches results for frequent lookups
  - Handles authentication pre-routing

### 3. Regional API Endpoints

- **Amazon API Gateway**:
  - Regional API endpoints in each supported region
  - Custom domain names with regional certificates
  - Regional caching for improved performance
  - Integration with regional Cognito user pools

- **Regional Routing Rules**:
  - Organization-based routing to appropriate backend
  - JWT token validation specific to region
  - Error handling for misrouted requests

## Routing Optimization Techniques

### 1. Initial Routing Strategy

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Opens App] --> B{First Launch?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Connect to Global Endpoint]
    B -- No --> D{Cached Region?}
    
    C --> E[Organization Lookup]
    E --> F[Determine Region]
    F --> G[Store Region Preference]
    G --> H[Connect to Regional Endpoint]
    
    D -- Yes --> H
    D -- No --> C
    
    H --> I[Authenticate with Regional Cognito]
    I --> J[Access Regional API]
```

- **First-Time Access**:
  - User connects to global endpoint via Global Accelerator
  - Organization lookup determines appropriate region
  - App stores regional preference locally
  - Subsequent connections go directly to regional endpoint

- **Returning Users**:
  - App uses cached regional endpoint
  - Fallback to global endpoint if regional connection fails
  - Periodic validation of regional assignment

### 2. Connection Optimization

- **Persistent Connections**:
  - WebSocket connections for real-time features
  - Connection pooling for API requests
  - Keepalive settings optimization

- **Request Batching**:
  - Group multiple API requests where possible
  - Reduce connection establishment overhead
  - Optimize for mobile network conditions

- **Predictive Prefetching**:
  - Anticipate user needs based on behavior
  - Prefetch likely-needed data during idle periods
  - Cache data locally for offline access

### 3. Failover and Resilience

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Primary Path"
        User --> RegionalEndpoint
        RegionalEndpoint --> RegionalBackend
    end
    
    subgraph "Failover Path"
        RegionalEndpoint -- "Failure" --> GlobalEndpoint
        GlobalEndpoint --> OrgLookup[Organization Lookup]
        OrgLookup --> AlternateEndpoint
        AlternateEndpoint --> AlternateBackend
    end
    
    subgraph "Recovery"
        HealthCheck[Health Checks] --> EndpointStatus[Endpoint Status]
        EndpointStatus --> RouteUpdate[Route Update]
        RouteUpdate --> RegionalEndpoint
    end
```

- **Health Checking**:
  - Regular health checks of regional endpoints
  - Automated failover to alternate endpoints
  - Recovery detection and route restoration

- **Circuit Breaking**:
  - Detect failing endpoints quickly
  - Prevent cascading failures
  - Graceful degradation of service

- **Regional Fallbacks**:
  - Predefined fallback regions for each primary region
  - Temporary access to data in alternate region if necessary
  - Clear user notification of temporary routing changes
